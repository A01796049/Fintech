        " 1. **Load and Explore Financial News Data:**\n",
        "    - Load a preprocessed dataset of financial news headlines and summaries related to S&P 500 companies.\n",
        "    - Inspect and structure relevant metadata including publication date, ticker, and provider.\n",

        " 2. **Build a Custom Vector Store:**\n",
        "    - Combine title and summary text for embedding.\n",
        "    - Implement a vector store from scratch with support for semantic search and optional metadata-based filtering using cosine similarity.\n",
        "\n",
        " 3. **Generate and Use Sentence Embeddings:**\n",
        "    - Apply a pre-trained transformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to encode text into embeddings for semantic analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        " 4. **Perform Semantic Search with Filtering:**\n",

        "\n",
        " 5. **Analyze Semantic Search Results:**\n",
        "    - Interpret and visualize results of search queries (e.g., \"AI announcement\").\n",
        "    - Identify temporal patterns and ticker frequency among top-ranked results.\n",
        "\n",
        " 6. **Implement a FAISS-Based Vector Store:**\n",
        "    - Normalize embeddings and use FAISS (IndexFlatIP) to enable efficient similarity search at scale.\n",
        "    - Compare FAISS-based search results with custom vector store results.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Step 2: Load Embedding Model\n",
        " - Load the 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' model from sentence-transformers.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 3: Define CustomVectorStore Class\n",

        " - '__init__': Accepts an embedding model, list of documents, and corresponding metadata. Computes and stores embeddings for all documents.\n",
        " - search: Takes a query and returns the top k most similar documents, optionally filtered using metadata.\n",
        "   - If a metadata_filter function is provided, apply it before computing similarity.\n",
        "   - Use cosine similarity to compute distances.\n",
        "   - Return the top k results as tuples of: (document, metadata, similarity score).\n",
        "\n",
        " ✅ **Requirements**:\n",
        " - Ensure the number of documents matches the number of metadata entries.\n",
        " - Make use of sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity.\n",

It is totally important because when we calculate how similar something is (cosine similarity), we don't want to measure it by how \"loud\" they are, but rather how similar their direction is. Normalizing makes the search look for things with the same meanings, like pointing the same direction in that space. For FAISS with IndexFlatIP, this is important since it simply performs a dot product, and that only equals cosine similarity if all's normalized.\n"
