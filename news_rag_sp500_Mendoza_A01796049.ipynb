        "1. **Perform Semantic Search with Metadata Filtering:**\n",
        "   - Query the provided FAISS vector store to retrieve relevant financial news articles based on natural language questions.\n",
        "   - Apply optional filters using metadata such as ticker or publication date to refine search results.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Enrich Data with Company Metadata:**\n",
        "   - Use the `yfinance` library to retrieve company-level metadata (company name, sector, industry) for tickers in the dataset.\n",
        "   - Integrate this metadata to support enhanced filtering and analysis of news data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline:**\n",
        "   - Combine retrieved news snippets as context to generate answers using OpenAI’s GPT models.\n",
        "   - Construct effective prompts that guide the language model to provide concise, context-aware responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Evaluate and Analyze RAG Outputs:**\n",
        "   - Review generated answers alongside the supporting news excerpts.\n",
        "   - Reflect on the strengths and limitations of the simple RAG pipeline and consider potential improvements, such as adding more filters or refining retrieval strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Incorporate Financial Metadata into Retrieval Context:**\n",
        "   - Enrich retrieved news snippets with key financial metadata including ticker, company name, sector, and industry.\n",
        "   - Format prompts that combine both text excerpts and metadata to provide richer context to the language model.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Generate Context-Aware Answers Using OpenAI Models:**\n",
        "   - Construct and send prompts to an LLM that leverage both news content and metadata to produce concise, informed financial analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Compare Answers With and Without Metadata:**\n",
        "   - Evaluate the impact of including financial metadata on answer quality using criteria such as clarity, detail, accuracy, and contextual relevance.\n",
        "   - Summarize findings to reflect on the role of metadata in improving retrieval-augmented generation."

This metadata will be useful later to add filters and analysis based on sector or industry categories.\n"

Rising food prices have dampened hopes for a rate cut, suggesting that inflationary pressures are affecting overall economic sentiment and monetary policy considerations.\n\n3. **Macro Economic Uncertainty**: The overall macroeconomic picture continues to be uncertain, leading analysts to lower earnings expectations. This uncertainty is compounded by inflation, which is seen as a drag on economic growth and corporate profitability.\n\n4. **Tariff Impacts**: New tariffs have contributed to rising costs, particularly in consumer goods, adding to inflationary pressures and affecting grocery bills, which have continued to increase.\n\n5. **Long-term Fiscal Concerns**: There are growing worries about the sustainability of fiscal policies, especially with the U.S. national debt surpassing $36 trillion. This has led to increasing demand for hard assets like gold as investors seek stability amid inflation and potential currency devaluation.\n\nOverall, these concerns reflect a complex interaction between inflation, economic growth, and fiscal policy, suggesting that inflation will continue to be a key focus for investors and policymakers in the near future."

On one hand, there are several articles highlighting stocks that are favored by Wall Street, often accompanied by ambitious price targets suggesting significant upside potential. However, there is a prevailing skepticism regarding these forecasts, as analysts are noted to be under institutional pressures that may lead to overly optimistic assessments. \n\nConversely, there are also articles pointing out stocks facing headwinds and bearish ratings from analysts, which are considered rare due to the potential risk of damaging corporate relationships that can affect other business lines, such as M&A advisory. These bearish sentiments suggest serious concerns about certain stocks and warrant attention from investors.\n\nOverall, while there are promising developments and strong fundamentals in some cases, a cautious approach is advised, especially for stocks receiving downbeat forecasts or facing significant challenges."

This indicates a growing focus on semiconductor stocks among investors looking for potential growth opportunities.\n\n2. **Earnings Performance**: There is a mix of optimism and concern around earnings reports. For instance, ON Semiconductor's recent soft earnings did not dampen shareholder confidence significantly. This suggests that investors may be looking beyond short-term earnings fluctuations to longer-term growth prospects.\n\n3. **Stock Price Movements**: Notably, ON Semiconductor's stock price surged by 30% over the past month despite reporting a net loss, which points to a disconnect between earnings performance and stock market sentiment. This could be attributed to factors like share buyback programs that bolster investor confidence.\n\n4. **Sector Challenges and Opportunities**: The semiconductor industry faces challenges such as declining demand in electric vehicles (EVs) but shows strong growth in areas like Silicon Carbide (SiC) and AI data centers. This reflects a shift in focus towards emerging technologies and applications that may drive future growth.\n\n5. **Market Trends and Forecasts**: Analysts are closely monitoring international revenue trends and overall market conditions, which could significantly impact forecasts for semiconductor companies. This includes assessing how companies are adapting to changing business environments post-pandemic.\n\nOverall, the semiconductor industry is characterized by a dynamic interplay of investor sentiment, earnings"

Other consumer discretionary sectors have also seen declines, such as a 12.3% drop in the last six months.\n\n2. **Volatile Demand**: Retailers are grappling with volatile consumer demand, which is closely linked to economic cycles. The recent performance suggests that demand trends are moving against the industry, leading to concerns over future sales.\n\n3. **Supply Chain Adjustments**: In response to changes in tariff policies and trade tensions, many retailers have shifted their supply chains and implemented price increases, which have already begun to affect shelf prices.\n\n4. **Inventory Challenges**: There are worries about potential inventory overflow due to a surge in imports ahead of a tariff pause between the US and China, which could lead to deeper discounts and margin pressure for retailers.\n\n5. **High Operating Costs**: The restaurant sector, a significant part of retail, is facing challenges due to high inventory and labor costs that result in thin profit margins, leaving little room for error if consumer demand decreases.\n\nOverall, the retail industry is navigating a complex landscape of declining stock performance, shifting consumer demand, supply chain adjustments, inventory management issues, and high operational costs."

This raises concerns about the future profitability of these companies.\n\n3. **Industrial Sector Decline**: The industrial sector, which is vital to the energy industry, has shown signs of a downturn, with significant stock declines over the past six months. This is compounded by high capital requirements and economic cycle vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Regulatory and Legal Risks**: Companies like Xcel Energy are grappling with wildfire litigation, which poses financial risks and uncertainties regarding liability and regulatory responses.\n\n5. **Economic Uncertainties**: Investors are wary of a potential prolonged economic downturn, which could affect demand across various sectors, including energy.\n\n6. **Valuation Concerns**: Some energy stocks are trading below their book values, indicating potential undervaluation but also raising questions about the overall health and future prospects of the sector.\n\nThese challenges reflect a complex landscape for the energy industry, marked by regulatory pressures, market dynamics, and economic factors."

This concern is central to the Fed's policy discussions and decisions.\n\n2. **Impact on Interest Rates**: Articles suggest that food inflation dampens expectations for potential rate cuts by the Fed. Analysts believe that ongoing inflation may prevent the Fed from lowering interest rates, which could affect borrowing costs and economic growth.\n\n3. **Consumer Price Pressures**: Rising prices in essential goods, such as groceries, are noted as a significant issue, leading consumers to seek strategies to mitigate the impact of inflation on their budgets. This has implications for consumer spending patterns and overall economic sentiment.\n\n4. **Geopolitical and Macroeconomic Factors**: Broader geopolitical tensions and uncertainties regarding fiscal policies are contributing to inflationary pressures, leading investors to seek stability in hard assets like gold.\n\nOverall, the narrative underscores that inflation remains a critical concern for the financial markets, influencing interest rate policies and consumer behavior amid a challenging economic landscape."

Many articles highlight stocks that analysts are bullish on, often citing significant upside potential and impressive fundamentals. However, there is also a notable emphasis on skepticism regarding the reliability of these optimistic forecasts, as analysts may face institutional pressures that lead to overly positive projections. Additionally, several articles point out stocks facing headwinds or bearish forecasts, suggesting that when Wall Street turns negative, it is important for investors to pay attention due to the rarity of such calls in the industry. Overall, while some stocks are performing well and attracting positive attention, there is a prevailing caution regarding the sustainability of these sentiments amid challenging market conditions."

This reflects a broader trend in the industry where companies are navigating fluctuating demand and economic conditions.\n\n4. **Stock Volatility and Recovery Strategies**: ON Semiconductor's stock experienced a sharp price surge despite reporting a net loss, attributed to share buyback programs aimed at bolstering investor confidence. This indicates a focus on strategies to recover stock performance amidst challenging market conditions.\n\n5. **Growth in Specific Segments**: The semiconductor sector is showing growth potential in niche areas such as Silicon Carbide (SiC) technologies and AI data centers, even as demand for electric vehicles (EVs) faces challenges. \n\nOverall, the semiconductor industry is characterized by a dynamic interplay of investor sentiment, revenue trends, and strategic responses to market fluctuations."

Over the past six months, retail stocks have tumbled by 13.7%, which is substantially worse than the S&P 500's 5.5% loss. This downturn is attributed to several factors, including volatility in consumer spending and the impact of supply chain adjustments due to ongoing trade tensions, specifically related to tariff policies. Retailers are adapting their business models to cope with these changes, but demand trends appear to be working against them, leading to concerns about the sustainability of their performance in the current economic climate."

This could render many renewable energy projects economically unviable, impacting companies like NextEra Energy and Enphase Energy, which are heavily invested in this space.\n\n2. **Oil Prices and Demand Challenges**: For oilfield service companies such as Halliburton and Baker Hughes, declining oil prices, rising tariffs, and shrinking drilling budgets pose substantial challenges. The industry is grappling with uncertain demand, particularly in sectors like LNG (liquefied natural gas) and the increased application of AI.\n\n3. **Economic Downturn Concerns**: Broader economic conditions are affecting industrial sectors, leading to forecasts of potential downturns. This is reflected in the performance of industrial stocks, which have seen declines, indicating a cautious outlook among investors.\n\n4. **Wildfire Liability and Regulatory Issues**: Utilities like Xcel Energy and Dominion Energy are facing legal and regulatory challenges related to wildfire liabilities. This adds another layer of risk as companies navigate litigation and potential federal solutions.\n\nOverall, the energy sector is contending with a complex mix of regulatory, economic, and operational challenges that could impact future growth and profitability."
